# Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-ND-Term3

The focus of this term is,

- Path Planning: brains of a self-driving car
- An elective (Semantic Segmentation OR Functional Safety)
- System Integration module

GitHub repository links to Term 3 projects are as given below.

## Projects

-------------

**1. Highway Path Planner**

Tie together prediction, behavior, and trajectory engines from the previous lessons to create an end-to-end path planner that drives the car in traffic.

Curriculum / Expert Instructors: Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America

Here is the link for the completed project - [SDC-P11-Path-Planner][1]

The goal of this module is to learn functional safety frameworks to ensure that vehicles is safe, both at the system and component levels.

Curriculum / Expert Instructors: Elektrobit

**3. Advanced Deep Learning Project: Semantic Segmentation (Optional)**

![semantic_segmentation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17127066/31305361-b0feafd4-ab55-11e7-891c-afc6da568bec.png)

To build a semantic segmentation network to identify free space on the road using fully convolutional networks. 

- Special techniques are used to create a semantic segmentation model that classifies each pixel of free space on the road. 
- To accelerate the networkâ€™s performance, inference optimizations like fusion, quantization, and reduced precision are implemented. 

Curriculum / Expert Instructors: NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute

Here is the link for the completed project - < TBD >

-------------

**4. System Integration**

To implement perception, path planning, and control sub-systems as ROS nodes and integrate software modules to get the simulated car to successfully navigate the test track.
